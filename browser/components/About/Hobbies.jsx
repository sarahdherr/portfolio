        <h4>YOGA</h4>
        <p>One of my favorite ways to release stress and recenter my mind is through the practice of yoga. The balance of the breath and the focus on my muscles gives me a much needed reset from the city.</p>

        <h4>SCIENCE</h4>
        <p>I have always been facinated by science and how things work. As a kid, I would often times convince my friends to do experiments with me. I still practice many experiments when I want to know what will happen.</p>

        <h4>HIKING</h4>
        <p>Since I was a child, I have been hiking with my family. We have hiked from our backyard in the Redwood Forest in California to the side of a glacier in Alaska. No matter how old I get, I enjoy the outdoors and peacefulness of hiking.</p>

        <h4>WINE</h4>
        <p>During my time in northern California, I had the wonderful experience working at a vinyard and winery. I learned as much as I could about wine while I was there, from what a brix is to how different oak can change the wine.</p>
